# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

The motivation behind Tweeter is for us, the students of Lighthouse Labs, to learn the ins and outs of front-end development creating a responsive, aesthetically pleasing, and well laid out mock up for a twitter-like website.

# Endnote

I have formatted the desktop version to favour the tweet feed instead of having a 50/50 split between the tweet feed and the profile information as I think this is more userfriendly and looks better. I have also avoided making the profile header scroll with the navbar in the mobile format unlike what some of the reference gifs showed as to fulfill the header requirements and make it scroll obscures most of the tweet-feed and does not look nice in my opinion. Also please notice the fun little animation I have added to the downward arrows icon in the top right corner, I am very proud of this touch.
